    <h2>My Dearest Nimue ❤️</h2>
    <p>
      Who would have thought that a simple game called <strong>FG</strong> would bring someone like you into my life?  
      I still remember the first time I tried to pair with you, and all I got was a short reply — <em>“auco”</em>.  
      That moment made me think you would never like me. 
    </p>
    <p>
      But life has its own beautiful surprises.  
      From that first rejection, here I am now, writing to you with a grateful heart,  
      because you’ve given me the chance to court you.  
    </p>
    <p>
      Nimue, thank you for opening your heart to me.  
      I never imagined I would like someone this much, but with you,  
      every moment feels different, special, and real.  
      I promise to treasure this chance and prove that my intentions are true.  
    </p>
    <p>
      Yours faithfully,  
      <br><strong>Kox</strong>
